I graduated with a bachelor degree of linguistics and master of applied data science. At the moment, I’m working as a Data Scientist in London. I have lived and worked in China, Germany and United Kingdom. The development of LLM (large language models) are exciting and motivates me to learn and grow. This is my personal blog where I document everything I’m learning about the recent development of NLP.</p> <p>Outside of my work, I enjoy travelling and biking, so occasionally you will probably see I write about my travels. :)</p> <p>One saying I like very much, share that to you as well. Have fun and keep it up :)</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It’s shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.”</em></p> <p><em>~Dune</em></p> </blockquote> </body></html>
